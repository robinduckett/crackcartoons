<p class="Standard-P" style="margin-top:0px"><span class="Emphasis-C">1. <a name="1"></a>How do you work?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">First we&#39;ll meet and talk about all the ideas and details you might have so I can
    get an understanding of what you want.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">Then I’ll provide you with a written price quote and a contract to sign.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">Ready to get started? I will need a 30% deposit and then it&#39;s sketching time!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">I will email you sketches of the project for you to approve; you can have up to 2
    sets of any needed changes.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">Once you are happy with the design, I start the project and will email you any progress
    photos.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">The final balance is due at completion.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="2"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">2. I’m not sure what I want drawn, please help!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Never fear!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I want my work to either calm, entertain, excite or enlighten you.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">So I can always show you a variety of different styles and ideas to help you to make
    a creative decision.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">In the meantime think about what mood you want my work to make you feel, then think
    about all the stories, characters, shapes and colours that strongly appeal to you.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">The following image will provide you with several inspiring ideas.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="3"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">3. What styles of art can you produce?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">I can offer up to six different art styles each with varying design and detail. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">The more simple the style is, the lower the cost.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">The more complex the style is, the higher the cost.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0"><a class="hlink_2" href="styles.html"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;">Click here</a> for samples will show you these differing styles and who they are recommended
    for.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C1"> </span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="4"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">4. Is there anything that you will not draw? </span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">What I draw for you all depends on what it is, where it is going and what it is used
    for. Any issues will be highlighted when discussing any idea that goes against my
    principles but the following will give you an idea of what I will never draw for
    anyone unless stated otherwise:</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> Alcohol – I will not draw any alcohol related themes unless it is at a licensed
    bar or if it is to publicly educate the dangers of irresponsible drinking.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> Illegal drugs – I will not draw any drug related themes unless it is to publicly
    educate the dangers of using them.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> Gore – I will not draw anything that is violent or disturbing. Drawing the use
    of weapons is subject to the age and location of the client.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> Pornography – I will not draw anything that is sexually obscene or illegal. Drawing
    minimal erotic art is subject to the age and location of the client.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> Discrimination – I will not draw anything that is designed to defame or promote
    intolerance towards any individual, ethnicity, gender, age group, disability, religion
    or sexuality.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> Copyrighted material – see <a href="#5" style="color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">DO YOU DRAW OTHER CARTOON CHARACTERS SUCH AS DISNEY?</a></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="5"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">5. Do you draw other cartoon characters such as Disney? </span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">For legal and personal reasons, the simple answer is no.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">But don&#39;t be discouraged!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">I can offer much more original and creative alternatives if you insist on having
    me draw Disney or other copyrighted characters.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="6"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">6. Why won’t you draw Disney?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">There are four specific reasons as to why I will not draw Disney or other copyrighted
    cartoon characters.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">1. It&#39;s illegal</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse or Spiderman are copyrighted and trademarked
    which means if they are owned by somebody else.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Only the owner of the cartoon character is allowed to make money from it.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Even if I drew it for free, using a copyrighted character can potentially promote
    my own business and is another way of making money from something that I don&#39;t own.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C-C0"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">2. It&#39;s unethical</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">It is true that corporations don&#39;t go out their way to hunting down small businesses
    that infringe copyright that is for personal use e.g. bedroom murals and even tattoos!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Because of this, some artists take the risk in infringing copyright law, but eventually
    get caught out when either they advertise their stolen or derivative work or even
    when the client shows off the work to others.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">3. It&#39;s unoriginal</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I love Disney, people love Disney, in fact so many people love Disney that it doesn’t
    really make you stand out from the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Furthermore fads and trends come and go so fast your child may quickly grow out of
    liking their mural. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I want clients to have an original painting that is unique only to them and can be
    liked for years to come.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">4. It&#39;s unproductive</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">Copying someone else’s work is too easy and uninspiring and this can trigger procrastination
    in an artist.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">An original artwork however is more challenging, as it requires the artist to make
    a special dedication in productivity to a unique project which always guarantees
    better results.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="7"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">7. I really wanted something Disney! Can you offer me an alternative?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I can give you seven different options:</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">1. Get permission or purchase the rights to use the copyrighted characters</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">These are the best options if you want full on copyrighted material, but you can
    either be denied permission or the royalties are too expensive to afford.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">2. Consider fair use of copyrighted characters by parodying them</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">It&#39;s okay to use other people&#39;s characters if you are distorting their personality
    and design for satirical purposes e.g. the friendly Mickey Mouse is drawn as an anti-social
    &#39;Ricky Rat&#39;.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I would however not recommend this option as cheap parodies wear off faster than
    the original works can.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">3. Have just a landscape and purchase stick-ons</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I would recommend that you hire me to paint a lush themed landscape.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Then to that mural you can purchase the licensed character wallpaper stick-ons to
    integrate into the mural.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">The fun part of this option is you could potentially move the characters anywhere
    you want in the room like a live theatre.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">4. Use public domain characters</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Remember that certain characters are now in the public domain.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Stories and their characters such as Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland
    have existed for so long that people can now freely use their characters in their
    own art and make a profit.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">The only issue is you can&#39;t copy the Disney versions as their designs are protected
    by copyright.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">5. Have similar themes to copyrighted characters and stories</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Ideas themselves aren’t copyrighted, so think about the themes that surround the
    stories and characters that your children like about them.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">For example, Lord of the Rings is a fantasy epic so whilst I can&#39;t draw Gandalf or
    Legolas from the films, I can still draw a wise wizard and an elf warrior on a quest
    battling goblins.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">6. Have something a bit more generic and play around with the idea</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Sometimes a child likes something about a character because of a certain aspect e.g.
    Harry Potter is all about magic, I like magic in general; therefore I like Harry
    Potter!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">So drawing anything to do with magic will still please your child.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Furthermore by making it more generic, your child might still grow up to like magic
    and the mural even if they no longer like Harry Potter.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Of course being generic isn&#39;t very exciting so let&#39;s mix things up a bit. Instead
    of having a generic magic school you could have a magic school trip to a magic zoo!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">7. Be super original!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">Has your child thought up of their own characters and ideas?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">Drawing out what they&#39;re creative vision is without a doubt the most effective way
    of further developing your child&#39;s imagination!</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="8"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">8. I want a mural made for my disabled child’s bedroom but I’m worried that the painting
    could upset them in some way. What would you recommend?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I fully understand and respect the sensitivities of disabled children and can advise
    these suggestions.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> It is most important that disabled children are fully comfortable with any changes
    made to their room.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I strongly recommend that you in first consult any ideas with the child for any surprise
    changes may severely confuse and upset them.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Standard-C"> If your child has recently been diagnosed with a disability, I strongly recommend
    take you undertake through research into the symptoms of the disability and seek
    professional advice in helping you connect with your child better and understanding
    what they like and don&#39;t like.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P1"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0"> Be aware that certain colours and shapes have a profound effect on a disabled child&#39;s
    stimuli.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">I strongly recommend selecting a theme that will help your child feel calm and secure
    in their bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="9"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">9. How far will you travel? Are there any additional travel costs?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I will travel up to 40 miles outside the Cardiff County Area.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">When travelling past 15 miles to get to and from your location my travel expense
    rate is 20 pence per mile.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">This charge does not include the first meeting when discussing ideas.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">If this affects and concerns you rest assured that when a project is commissioned
    we can work out what days I will be able to work for you and maintain a schedule,
    thereby minimising any additional travel costs.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="10"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">10. Are there any hidden / extra costs?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">There are no hidden or extra costs apart from three exceptions:</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">The first exception is if travelling past 15 miles to get to and from your destination;
    my travel expense rate will be 20 pence per mile. This charge does not include the
    first meeting when discussing ideas.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">The second exception is if I have to change the sketches for a third time.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">You can have up to 2 sets of any needed changes but any more and you will be charged
    an additional 30% of the original quoted price.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">The third exception is if you do not pay when the remaining balance is due.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">You will receive a reminder informing you that a 3% interest fee will be charged
    if the remaining balance is not paid within ten days after the project is finished.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>
<p class="Standard-P"><a name="11"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">11. How much do you charge for painting a mural?</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">My mural prices are determined by the size of the project and the complexity of the
    artwork.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I charge per Square Foot, which is determined by multiplying the height x width of
    the painting surface.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">This charging per Square Foot can increase if a higher amount of detail and complicated
    design is required.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">However, the larger the area required, the lower the charging per Square Foot!</span></p>

<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Like with how much a mural costs, the amount of time it will it take depends on the
    size of the area and the complexity of the details required.</span></p>

<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I will take a five minute breather for every hour I work. I do this because by taking

<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">I will also take a half hour lunch break.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C"><br></span></p>

    on the premises at all times.</span></p>

<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">I personally love meeting dogs of any breed, however if I feel that your dog is aggressive
    or a nuisance towards me then I will politely ask if can you keep it restrained.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Emphasis-C-C0">If your dog is considered by law to be a dangerous breed then please can you keep
    it restrained in advance.</span></p>

    when I arrive or finish for the day.</span></p>
<p class="Standard-P-P0"><span class="Standard-C">Offers of tea and coffee are up to the client&#39;s generosity.</span></p>

<p class="Standard-P"><a name="25"></a><span class="Emphasis-C">25. I’m really happy with the work you have done for me. Can I give you a little
    extra something?</span></p>
